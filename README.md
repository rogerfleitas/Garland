# Garland
A Java program that utilizes a linked list of different linked lists in order to create a "garland".

A garland is a linked list structure that creates nodes in a "garland" pattern. 

This means that the very top row of nodes are the heads of separate individual linked lists, while the nodes going down are simply the nodes of those connected linked lists.

The top-left most node represents the head of the garland, while the top-right most node represents the tail.

Here is a visual representation of what a Garland structure looks like using individual characters as the data type: https://imgur.com/a/lr0Nrgn
